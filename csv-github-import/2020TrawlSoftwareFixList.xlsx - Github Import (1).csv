"Wheelhouse,bug","Trawl Survey,Wheelhouse,bug",TowLogger,Fix,Trawl: TowLogger: creeping wheelhouse computer clock (Fix),creeping wheelhouse computer clock,Aaron,"Wheelhouse comptuer clock creep issues in 2019 (some folks encountered this others did not). Make sure computer clock still updates from GPS or Sat compass every 5 mins. Would be great if we can use this code for HookLogger software, too! [WS - code was added May 2017] "
"Backdeck,bug","Trawl Survey,Backdeck,bug",Validations,Fix / Bug,Trawl: Validations: Mix aggregate wt warning (Fix / Bug),Mix aggregate wt warning,Pete,"Still getting 'Mix aggregate wt' error almost every tow, not useful as is since we all just ignore it"
"Backdeck,bug","Trawl Survey,Backdeck,bug",Fish Sampling,Fix / Bug,Trawl: Fish Sampling: Bagged age structure barcode issue (Fix / Bug),Bagged age structure barcode issue,Beth,"Seems like everyone is all over this already, but make sure that whatever is causing this age specimen glitch gets solved"
"Wheelhouse,enhancement","Trawl Survey,Wheelhouse,enhancement",TowLogger,Would be nice,Trawl: TowLogger: Troubleshoot running net averages (Would be nice),Troubleshoot running net averages,Pete,Seemed to be having lots of problems with ave spread / height displayed. Maybe review order of sensors producing this

"Wheelhouse,enhancement","Trawl Survey,Wheelhouse,enhancement",Towlogger,Would be nice,Trawl: Towlogger: green 'in the box' = ITI position (Would be nice),green 'in the box' = ITI position,Pete,"Would be great to make the real-time 'in the box / distance from box' reflect ITI net position (as it used to be before T2) instead of vessel position even though ITI isn't always accurate; [JH:  would also add to this to ensure that ""distance to cell"" measurement is accurate - this might have been totally fixed, but I thought I recall there were some lingering issues with it not always being correct]"
"Wheelhouse,enhancement","Trawl Survey,Wheelhouse,enhancement",Serial Ports,Would be nice,Trawl: Serial Ports: something missing' placeholder meatball (Would be nice),something missing' placeholder meatball,Pete,"If one of the standard meatballs gets deleted, would be useful to have a grey 'hey, where'd my PI44 go?' placeholder meatball for expected data streams. Easy for things to just disappear and look OK if all meatballs are green"
"Wheelhouse,enhancement,low-priority","Trawl Survey,Wheelhouse,enhancement,low-priority",Integrator,Longterm,Trawl: Integrator: Incorporate elements of Trawl Analyzer to Integrator (Longterm),Incorporate elements of Trawl Analyzer to Integrator,Pete,"Both for improved ease of use by FPCs and to speed up post-season processing by allowing the first steps to happen on the boat (move waypoints, shift ITI delays, delete bad points, etc.)"
"Backdeck,enhancement,low-priority","Trawl Survey,Backdeck,enhancement,low-priority",Validations,Longterm,Trawl: Validations: Refine validations to streamline post season processing (Longterm),Refine validations to streamline post season processing,Beth,Used to get a lot more warnings when we had Survey Edit. Are addtional validations that would help avoid the most common issues that Beth is encountering after the fact?
"Backdeck,bug ","Trawl Survey,Backdeck,bug ",Specimen labels,Fix,Trawl: Specimen labels: Restructure how specimen label numbers are assigned.  (Fix),Restructure how specimen label numbers are assigned. ,Aaron,"It is not clear how specimen label numbers (the last four characters on the tag label, e.g., 042B) are assigned. It seems like for a project with multiple species, it begins at 001A for each species, and is somewhat tied to tow numbers. This has caused problems with duplicate numbers in 2016, as well as with the new 'shortcut' (upper right-hand number on the tag) label that began in 2018. My solution for this: instead of starting at the species level, start at the project level (last set of 3-digits in the long specimen label code) and assign starting at one and increase by one with every sample taking. Example, starting for rockfish stomachs on the Excalibur: bocaccio stomach from tow #1: 2020-008-001-002-001A; then yellowtail stomach from tow #1: 2020-008-002-002-002A; then canary stomach from tow #2: 2020-008-002-002-003A. Yes, this will give us only 999 available specimen label numbers per project by doing it this way, but that is per vessel. We never collect that many stomachs, tissues, ovaries or any other structures where we print a specimen label on a single vessel. "
"Wheelhouse,bug ","Trawl Survey,Wheelhouse,bug ",TowLogger,Fix,"Trawl: TowLogger: ""Hey, you've already searched this station"" pop-up (Fix)","""Hey, you've already searched this station"" pop-up",Aaron,"This warning is displayed when you've either intentionally or accidentally populated a certain station number in TowLogger, regardless of whether you actually initiated a search. Solution probably needs to be two-fold: 1. Only display this pop-up warning if you actually have started a search and wish to come back (does happen, although uncommon) or, 2. Add a cancel button (can't remember exactly the options off the top of my head, but the I recall the current options don't necessarily make sense). "
"Wheelhouse,bug ","Trawl Survey,Wheelhouse,bug ",TowLogger,Fix,Trawl: TowLogger: Tow timer accuracy (Fix),Tow timer accuracy,Harms,"This may also have been totally fixed as of last year (and may be related to computer clock drift issues), but ensure that tow timer starts at 0:00 and that the prompt to haul back at 15:00; there had been some issues with the haul back prompt occurring early, or even not at all."

trawl analyzer,trawl analyzer,Improve,make 'lat / lons' and 'depth signal' sticky,Trawl Analyzer: make 'lat / lons' and 'depth signal' sticky (Would be nice - means),means,Pete,Would be SO nice if selected 'lat / lons' and 'depth signal' would stick from what you selected in trackline when you go to calculate means
trawl analyzer,trawl analyzer,Improve,Add 'undo' and 'previous view' buttons,Trawl Analyzer: Add 'undo' and 'previous view' buttons (Would be nice - sensors),sensors,Pete,"Need an 'undo' button if you delete / shift the wrong thing, a prevoius view button like in Integrator would also be nice"
trawl analyzer,"trawl analyzer,bug",Fix,Mouse-shifting issue for deleting bad points,Trawl Analyzer: Mouse-shifting issue for deleting bad points (Would be nice - bad points),bad points,Pete,Would be good to eliminate shift that makes it difficult to delete multiple points using the sensor display without having to pull up the series in 'review data'
trawl analyzer,trawl analyzer,Improve,Orient vessel 'triangle' waypoint mark using compass,Trawl Analyzer: Orient vessel 'triangle' waypoint mark using compass (Longterm - trackline),trackline,Pete,"Might be a longshot, but would be amazing if the vessel position triangles in the trackline display were oriented using the compass heading at that waypoint. This would make it easier to decide if ITI tracks seem plausible or if caternary should be preferred."
