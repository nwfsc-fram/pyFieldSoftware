Backdeck,"Trawl Survey,Backdeck",Specimen labels,Fix,Trawl: Specimen labels: Restructure how specimen label numbers are assigned.  (Fix),Restructure how specimen label numbers are assigned. ,Aaron,"It is not clear how specimen label numbers (the last four characters on the tag label, e.g., 042B) are assigned. It seems like for a project with multiple species, it begins at 001A for each species, and is somewhat tied to tow numbers. This has caused problems with duplicate numbers in 2016, as well as with the new 'shortcut' (upper right-hand number on the tag) label that began in 2018. My solution for this: instead of starting at the species level, start at the project level (last set of 3-digits in the long specimen label code) and assign starting at one and increase by one with every sample taking. Example, starting for rockfish stomachs on the Excalibur: bocaccio stomach from tow #1: 2020-008-001-002-001A; then yellowtail stomach from tow #1: 2020-008-002-002-002A; then canary stomach from tow #2: 2020-008-002-002-003A. Yes, this will give us only 999 available specimen label numbers per project by doing it this way, but that is per vessel. We never collect that many stomachs, tissues, ovaries or any other structures where we print a specimen label on a single vessel. "
