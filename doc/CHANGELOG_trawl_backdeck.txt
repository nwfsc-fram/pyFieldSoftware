Change Log - Trawl Backdeck Software

*****************************************************************************************************************
TODO
*****************************************************************************************************************
- FIELD-670 - FishSamplingScreen - Take barcode from scanner, auto-focus back on Weight TextField
- FIELD-671- FishSamplingScreen - Small weight is still overriding barcode if typing small manual weight, then barcode comes in, 
		then hit ok on the manual weight button
- FIELD-668 - SpecialActionsScreen - Printing would sometimes not work, but need to be initiated from FishSamplingScreen
- FIELD-669 - FishSamplingScreen - Weight + Barcode sounds can null each other out - default to barcode sound 
- FIELD-672 - WeighBasketsScreen - Military? / Fishing? - add options
		
- QAQC - For a mix, must be at least one subsample and one non-subsample present
		
		
- T2 / Integrator - happens with the first haul or first two morning tows - only see waypoints, no sensor data
- T2 / TowLogger - Start haul clock at 00:00, not 00:22, i.e. not GPS offset time	
- T2 / Trawl Performance - Clear out previous tow notes / status / min-time met





*****************************************************************************************************************
TESTING
*****************************************************************************************************************
- FishSamplingScreen.qml - highlight specimen, populate appropriate TextFields + TableView values - I think this is already fixed
- pyCollector - Test Integrator against new daily sensors_YYYYMMDD.db files - 
- pyCollector - Test Daily Backup - does it properly get C:\PyData2016 + sensors_YYYYMMDD.db + trawl wheelhouse+backdeck databases
- SpecialActionsScreen.qml - initialize_list - confirm works properly once have Ovaries with Leg + Length (i.e. 2) sub-strata
- HaulSelection.py - delete_test_haul - Check for CATCH + SPECIMEN associated with Haul and if they exist, show dialog to confirm deletion

- pyCollector - HOBOWARE 1-hour shift - confirm that BCS data is no longer shifted



- Calibration Testing Software
