# Python Field Software 
- This repository includes OPTECS, Trawl and Hook and Line survey code

- Note that this does not include any data and will not be useable out-of-the-box to the general public (there are missing databases,) but could have some code snippets of use to someone. (Please do not consider our PyQt a good reference for "best practices" as there is quite a bit that was simply hacked out.)

### See [oldREADME.md](oldREADME.md) for archived build notes
